            <h3 align=justify style="width: 50%">And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation, and to all the pure in heart—For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it—Therefore, that <i>we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to light all the hidden things of darkness,</i> wherein we know them; and they are truly manifest from heaven—These should then be attended to with great earnestness. (Doctrine and Covenants 123:11-14)</h3>
