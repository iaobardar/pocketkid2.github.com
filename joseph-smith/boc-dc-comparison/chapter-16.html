        <div align="center">
            <p>The phrases in verse 1 are re-arranged. This was likely done to fix the awkward beginninging of the text, since the chapter heading already provides somewhat of an introduction, which language has since been discontinued.</p>
            <p>Verses 13-15 are expanded significantly to clarify the source and nature of the call to repentence.</p>
            <p>Extra clarification given in verse 18 to clear up potential confusion.</p>
            <p>Verse 20 is changed in a similar way as verses 13-15, but to a lesser extend. The phrase of being commanded "by" God's Almighty power is again rephrased to being commanded to repent.</p>
            <p>The concepts in verses 21-24 are broken up and revised for clarity.</p>
            <p>Stylistic change in verses 25, 26, and 28 to make the language more consistent.</p>
            <p>Update in verse 32 to reflect future perspectives.</p>
            <p>Verses 35 and 36 expanded for clarity.</p>
