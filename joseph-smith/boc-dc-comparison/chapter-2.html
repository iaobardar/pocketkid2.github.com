            <p>Change 1 (verse 10): Verse changed to past tense at the end, and the statement of the future result of Joseph Smith's repentance is replaced with a statement clarifying the disobedience. This is the first of many examples of Joseph Smith editing the future and present-tense text to sound present or past-tense respectively.</p>
            <p>Change 2 (verses 16-18): Instead of a knowledge of the Nephites coming to the Lamanites, it is the knowledge of the Savior that is coming to the remnant of both the Nephites and the Lamanites through the testimony of their fathers (the righteous Nephites). I suspect there are two reasons for this shift. 1) To focus on the testimony of Christ instead of the people, and 2) to make clear that the remnant of the Nephites will also receive the Book of Mormon and learn about their righteous ancestors in addition to the Lamanites receiving the record.</p>
