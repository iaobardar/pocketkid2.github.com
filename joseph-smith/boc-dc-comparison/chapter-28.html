            <p>This revelation has one of the most extensive and unique additions of any revelation. A list of righteous patriarchs and ministering angels are listed, that will partake of the fruit of the vine in the kingdom of God with Joseph Smith. It is not certain why this change was made.</p>
            <p>The second change consists of the parable of the armor of God at the end of the revelation. It is also unclear why this major addition was made.</p>

He was met by a heavenly messenger and received this revelation, a portion of which was written at the time and the remainder in the September following.
