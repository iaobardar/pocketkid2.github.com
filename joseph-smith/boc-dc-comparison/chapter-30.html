            <p>This revelation has several minor changes, several of which are worthy of note:</p>
            <p>Verse 1 and 2 - clarifying and stylistic changes</p>
            <p>Verse 8 - Clarifies that the church is built only where the message is received. It is likely that this change was added after the mission to the "Lamanites" (American Indians) was met with less success than they had anticipated.</p>
            <p>Verse 9 - the word Zion was added to clarify which city the Lord was speaking of</p>
            <p>Verse 10 - The word "rule" is replaced with the more proper term "preside over"</p>
            <p>Verse 14 - Oliver is to assist, rather than to take primary responsibility. This change could have been made to show that Joseph and others still had the power to correcet Hiram Page.</p>

Hiram Page, a member of the Church, had a certain stone and professed to be receiving revelations by its aid concerning the upbuilding of Zion and the order of the Church. Several members had been deceived by these claims, and even Oliver Cowdery was wrongly influenced thereby. Just prior to an appointed conference, the Prophet inquired earnestly of the Lord concerning the matter, and this revelation followed.</p></td>
