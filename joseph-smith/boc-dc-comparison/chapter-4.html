        <div align="center">
            <p>This revelation contains some of the most controversial and thorough changes.</p>
            <p>Change 1: In the original, the revelation is addressed to Joseph and Martin and in some places, "this generation", in the third person. The change makes the revelation addressed directly and exclusively to Joseph in the second-person and clarifies at different times who the Lord is addressing specifically. In some cases, such as verse 26 and 29, this clears up ambiguity.</p>
            <p>Change 2: In the original text of what is now verse 4, the revelation speaks of Joseph as only having the gift of translating the Book of Mormon. At the time this revelation was given, that was correct, because Joseph did not learn about his future tasks until after the translation. The update reflects A) Joseph's faithfulness in translating and publishing the Book of Mormon and B) that he afterwards received additional commandments and gifts.</p>
            <p>Change 3: In a similar vein as change 2, in verses 10-12 we see a shift in how the witnesses are viewed. Joseph is the primary witness, the three are also called, and it also leaves the door open for the eight witnesses.</p>
            <p>Change 4: Verses 5 and 6 in the original are rewritten and summarized in verses 18 and 19 in the current edition.</p>
            <p>Change 5: Verse 6 in the current edition is an addition, which explains how the missionary program fulfills the promises made in this revelation.</p>
            <p>Change 6: Verse 14 gives us extra details about how this relates to the coming forth of the restored church of Jesus Christ.</p>
