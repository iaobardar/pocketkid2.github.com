            <p>The change from 'corruptible' to 'corrupted' in verse 11 (D&C) is one that Joseph Smith notified the brethren in Zion about in the summer of 1833 via letter which would have been around the time the press was destroyed, while the book of commandments was still in printing. The same is true of the change from 'to' to 'of' in verses 16 and 26 (D&C)</p>
