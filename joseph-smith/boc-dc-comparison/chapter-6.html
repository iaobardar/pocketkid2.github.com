        <div align="center">
            <p>Change: Extra details are given in verses 1-3, 5, and verses 6 and 7 are added. Much greater clarity to the meaning is added but the reason for such a large change is unclear. It is noteworthy to point out, however, that verse 6 reflects Joseph Smith's later understanding of angels (ministering spirits) and verse 7 reflects his later understanding of Peter, James, and John holding the keys of the priesthood.</p>
