        <div align="center">
            <p>Minor grammar edits in verses 1, 11, and 12.</p>
            <p>Major change 1: "rod of nature" (or in the manuscripts, "sprout") changed to "gift of Aaron"</p>
            <p>Major change 2: The gift is explained more clearly and verse 8 is almost entirely new.</p>
            <p>Change 3: Extra details are given in verses 9, 10, and 11 about their respective statements.</p>
            <p>Overall, these changes help to clarify and add extra detail. Since little detail about Oliver Cowdery's gift is known, perhaps the change to "gift of Aaron" was made to reduce shock or wonder.</p>
