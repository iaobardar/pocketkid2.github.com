            <p>"Adam-ondi-Ahman" (originally "This Earth Was Once a Garden Place") . . . quickly became one of the most popular songs of the early church</p>
            
            <p>The hymn was written by W[illiam] W. Phelps, an early church member and poet. The music comes from the 1835 Southern Appalachian folk hymn "Prospect of Heaven".</p>
            
            <p>The term Adam-ondi-Ahman refers to the place that Adam and Eve went after they were evicted from the Garden of Eden.</p>
            
            <p>"Enoch walked with God" is a quote from the Book of Genesis, "And Enoch walked with God: and he was [no more]; for God took him" (Gen 5:24). The Epistle to the Hebrews expands on this: "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God" (Heb 11:5).</p>
            
            <p>In Latter-day Saint theology, Enoch founded the city of Zion on earth, which God eventually took up into heaven because of the righteousness of its inhabitants. "I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom" (D&C 38:4).</p>

                <p>1 This earth was once a garden place,

                <br>And men did live a holy race,
                <br>And worship Jesus face to face,

                <br>And saints and angels <u>sung</u> aloud
                <br>In Adam-ondi-Ahman.</p>
                
                <p>3 Her land was good and greatly blest,
                <br>Beyond <s>old</s> Israel’s Canaan:
                <br>Her fame was known from east to west;
                <br>Her peace was great, and pure the rest
                <br>Of Adam-ondi-Ahman.</p>

                <br>Like Adam-ondi-Ahman.</p>
