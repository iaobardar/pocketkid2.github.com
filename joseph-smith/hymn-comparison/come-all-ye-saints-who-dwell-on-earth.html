                <p>1 Come all ye saints, who dwell on earth,
                <br>Your cheerful voices raise,
                <br>Our great Redeemer’s love to sing,

                <br>Shall meet where Christ is gone.</p>
                
                <p>4 And there we’ll join the heav’nly choir,
                <br>And sing his praise above;
                <br>While endless ages roll around,
                <br>Perfected by his love.</p>
