                <p>1 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
                <br>Is laid for your faith in his excellent word;
                <br>What more can he say than to you he hath said?
                <br><s>You</s>, who unto <s>Jesus</s>, for refuge have fled.</p>
                
                <p>2 In <u>every</u> condition—in sickness, in health,
                <br>In poverty’s vale, or abounding in wealth,
                <br>At home <s>and</s> abroad, on the land, <s>on</s> the sea,
                <br>As thy days may demand, so thy succor shall be.</p>
                
                <p>3 Fear not, I am with thee; <u>O</u> be not <u>dismay’d</u>!
                <br>For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
                <br>I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
                <br>Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.</p>
                
                <p>4 When through the deep waters I call the[e] to go,
                <br>The rivers of sorrow shall not the[e] o’erflow;
                <br>For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
                <br>And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.</p>
                
                <p>5 When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
                <br>My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
                <br>The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
                <br>Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.</p>
                
                <p>6 E’en down to old age, all my people shall prove
                <br>My <u>sovereign</u>, eternal, unchangeable love;
                <br>And then, when grey <u>hairs</u> shall their temples adorn,
                <br>Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.</p>
                
                <p>7 The soul that on Jesus hath <u>lean’d</u> for repose,
                <br>I will not, I cannot desert to his foes.
                <br>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
                <br>I’ll never—no, never, no never forsake!</p>
