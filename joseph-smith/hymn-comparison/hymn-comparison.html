            <h1>1835 vs 1985 Hymnal Comparison</h1>
            <h4>An Analysis of the textual differences between hymns found in both the original and the most recent LDS Hymnal</h4>

        <div>
            <p>
                The name from the 1985 edition of the hymnbook is used for familiarity reasons. Information about music and text is taken from the 1985 hymnbook, and is thus not always accurate for original tunes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brief analysis of changes is given at the beginning of each comparison. Line or phrase repeats are not printed or discussed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some changes involve verse and line breaks and repeats and are not mentioned unless significant.
                <br>Key to formatting:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Underlined Text:</u> words or phrases where there is no textual change but the words are typed or spelled differently.</li>
                    <li><b>Bold Text:</b> words or phrases that were added or replaced other words</li>
                    <li><s>Strikeout Text:</s> words or phrases that were removed or replaced by other words or phrases</li>
                </ul>
