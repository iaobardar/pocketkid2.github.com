            <p>Text by Isaac Watts (1674-1748) and William W. Phelps (1792-1872)</p>
            <p>Music by George F. Handel (1685-1759) and Lowell Mason (1792-1872)</p>
            <p>{insert original text at some point}</p>
            <p>Originally written by Isaac Watts as a Christmas hymn, this song was adapted for the LDS hymnbook by William W. Phelps who wrote new lyrics that reflected a millennial theme as opposed to a Christmas theme. By the 1985 hymnbook, however, the lyrics were rolled back to their original Christmas meaning.</p>
