                <p>4 May we no more our <u>powers</u> abuse,
                <br>But ways of truth and goodness choose;
                <br>Our God is <u>pleas’d</u> when we improve
                <br>His grace, and seek his perfect love.</p>
                
                <p><s>5 It’s my free will for to believe:

                <br>It’s all free grace, and all free will.</s></p>
                
                <p><s>6 Those that despise, grow harder still;
                <br>Those that adhere, he turns their will:

                <br>And make in hell our last abode:
                <br>Our God is clear, and we shall know,
                <br>We’ve plunged ourselves in endless wo.</s></p>
