                <br>Her light begins to shine,
                <br>Ere long her King will rend the skies,
                <br>Majestic and divine.

                <br>A people to prepare,
                <br>To meet the Lord and Enoch’s band,

                <p>2 Ye heralds sound the <s>gospel</s> trump,
                <br>To earth’s remotest bound;
                <br>Go spread the news from pole to pole,
                <br>In all the nations round,
                <br>That Jesus in the clouds above,
                <br>With hosts of angels too,
                <br>Will soon appear his saints to save,
                <br>His enemies subdue.</p>
                
                <p><s>3 But ere that great and solemn day,
                <br>The stars from heav’n will fall,

                <br>The waters into gall,
                <br>The sun with blackness will be cloth’d,
                <br>All nature look affright!
                <br>While men, rebellious wicked men,
                <br>Gaze heedless on the sight.</s></p>

                <br>When God’s command goes forth;
                <br>The mountains sink the valley rise,
                <br>And all become a plain,
                <br>The islands, and the continents
                <br>Will then unite again.</s></p>
                
                <p><s>5 Alas! the day will then arrive,
                <br>When rebels to God’s grace,
                <br>Will call for rocks to fall on them,
                <br>And hide them from his face:
                <br>Not so with those who keep his law,
                <br>They joy to meet their Lord
                <br>In clouds above, with them that slept
                <br>In Christ, their sure reward.</s></p>
                
                <p>6 That glorious rest will then commence,
                <br>Which prophets did foretell,
                <br>When <s>Christ</s> will reign, with <s>saints</s> on earth
                <br>And in <s>their</s> presence dwell
                <br>A thousand years: <u>O</u> glorious day!
                <br>Dear Lord prepare my heart,
                <br>To stand with thee, on Zion’s mount,
                <br>And <u>never more</u> to part.</p>
                
                <p><s>7 Then when the thousand years are past,

                <br>By fire from heav’n sent down,
                <br>Until our great last change shall come,
                <br>T’ immortalize this clay,
                <br>Then we in the celestial world,
                <br>Will spend eternal day.</s></p>
