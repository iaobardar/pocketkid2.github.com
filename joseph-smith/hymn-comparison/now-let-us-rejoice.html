                <p>3 We’ll love one another and never dissemble,
                <br>But cease to do evil and ever be one;

                <p>5 In faith we’ll rely on the arm of Jehovah,
                <br>To guide <u>through</u> these last days of trouble and gloom;
                <br>And after the scourges and harvest are over,
                <br>We’ll rise with the just, when the Savior doth come:</p>
