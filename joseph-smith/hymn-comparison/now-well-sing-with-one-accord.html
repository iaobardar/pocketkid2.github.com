            <p>Verse 2 (1985) has been updated to reflect past tense in reference to Joseph Smith. Verse 3 (1985) has the second half rewritten to reflect the general audience the revelations are addressed to. Verse 4 (1985) is changed to reflect the future of the saints as a whole instead of specifically Joseph Smith.</p>

                <br>For the Gentile and the Jew,
                <br>He translated sacredly.</p>
