            <p>Text by Isaac Watts (1674-1748)</p>

            <p>Excerpt from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_God,_Our_Help_in_Ages_Past">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
            <p>"Our God, Our Help in Ages Past" is a hymn by Isaac Watts in 1708 that paraphrases the 90th Psalm of the Book of Psalms. It originally consisted of nine stanzas; however, in present usage the fourth, sixth, and eighth stanzas are commonly omitted to leave a total of six (Methodist books also include the original sixth stanza to leave a total of seven). In 1738, John Wesley in his hymnal, Psalms and Hymns, changed the first line of the text from "Our God" to "O God." Both Watts' wording and Wesley's rewording remain in current use.</p>
            <p>The 1985 more closely matches more modern renditions of this hymn, and some verses have been removed to bring the total down to just four verses.</p>
