            <p>Text by William W. Phelps (1792-1872)</p>
            <p>Excerpts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_God_Like_a_Fire_Is_Burning">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
            <p>The hymn was sung for the dedication of Kirtland Temple, 27 March 1836. In the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Keith W. Perkins has stated that the hymn was written for this occasion.</p>
            <p>It is sung as part of the Hosanna Anthem, a special piece for the dedication of all LDS Church temples.</p>
            <p>No textual differences between the two versions, except in the 1835 hymnal, the chorus for the last verse changes "<b>the</b> armies of heaven" to "<b>his</b> armies of heaven"</p>

                <p>1 The Spirit of God like a fire is burning;
                <br>The latter day glory begins to come forth;
                <br>The visions and blessings of old are returning;
                <br>The angels are coming to visit the earth.</p>
                
                <p>(Chorus)
                <br>We’ll sing & we’ll shout with the armies of heaven:
                <br>Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!
                <br>Let glory to them in the highest be given,
                <br>Henceforth and forever: amen and amen!</p>
                
                <p>2 The Lord is extending the saints’ understanding—
                <br>Restoring their judges and all as at first;
                <br>The knowledge and power of God are expanding
                <br>The vail o’er the earth is beginning to burst.</p>
                
                <p>3 We call in our solemn assemblies, in spirit,
                <br>To spread forth the kingdom of heaven abroad,
                <br>That we through our faith may begin to inherit
                <br>The visions, and blessings, and glories of God.</p>
                
                <p><s>4 We’ll wash, and be wash’d, and with oil be anointed
                <br>Withal not omitting the washing of feet:
                <br>For he that receiveth his penny appointed,
                <br>Must surely be clean at the harvest of wheat.</s></p>
                
                <p><s>5 Old Israel that fled from the world for his freedom,
                <br>Must come with the cloud and the pillar, amain:
                <br>A Moses, and Aaron, and Joshua lead him,
                <br>And feed him on manna from heaven again.</s></p>
                
                <p>6 How blessed the day when the lamb and the lion
                <br>Shall lie down together without any ire;
                <br>And Ephraim be <u>crown’d</u> with his blessing in Zion,
                <br>As Jesus descends with his chariots of fire!</p>
