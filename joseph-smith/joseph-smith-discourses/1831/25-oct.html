            <p>Event: General Conference of the church</p>
            <p>Location: Serenus Burnett's house, Orange Township, Cuyahoga County, Ohio. (About five miles south of Kirtland, Ohio)</p>
            <p>The excerpts featured here are from minutes found in <i>Minute Book 2</i>, also known as the "Far West Record." Oliver Cowdery was the clerk of the conference, and the version recorded in the minute book is in Ebenezer Robinson's hand. There were at least two earlier versions of the minutes which are no longer extant.</p>
            <p>Two of the most interesting excerpts from these minutes were published for the first time in <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> by Joseph Fielding Smith in 1938, who had access to the Far West Record, which at that time was not publicly available or published.</p>
            <p>The presentation here will be as follows: The column on the left will be the original minutes, transcription copied from Joseph Smith Papers website, with each row corresponding to a paragraph or excerpt from the minutes. The right column will feature the same content found in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, where found. For full context, reader may wish to read the full minutes and annotations from the Joseph Smith Papers website linked in the table below.</p>
            <p>Textual differences are noted with <u>underlines</u>, while words appearing in only one version are <b>bolded</b>, in either column. <s>Strikeouts</s> in the left column represent strikeouts in the actual manuscript source.</p>
