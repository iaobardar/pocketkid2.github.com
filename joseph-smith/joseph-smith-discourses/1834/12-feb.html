            <h1>Discourse of Joseph Smith given February 12th, 1834</h1>

            <p>Event: Council of priesthood brethren</p>
            <p>Location: Joseph Smith's house in Kirtland, Ohio</p>
            <p>The following discourse comes from minutes of a meeting that took place Thursday evening, February 12th, 1834. According to the minutes, <i>"the high Priests and Elders of the Church in Kirtland [were assembled] at the house of bro. Joseph Smith Jun. in Council for Church business."</i> The clerk was Orson Hyde, and he very shortly thereafter copied the minutes himself into Minute Book 1. They were eventually copied into the Manuscript History book A-1 by Willard Richards on June 19th, 1843. It was then printed in the 15 August 1845 issue of the Times and Seasons, as part of the "History of Joseph Smith" serial. It is now found in the official (Documentary) History of the Church, Volume 2, beginning on page 25.</p>
            <p>This discourse is also found in <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> pages 69-70, and may be included in a comparison in the future.</p>
            <p>The topic of the discourse revolves around order and discipline in church councils, and Joseph Smith gave this general counsel and testimony as an introduction to the church business that would then follow.</p>
            <p>The table contains links to the different editions, their labels, and the introductory material that will not be compared in the collation. Notable differences (not misspellings or capitalization differences) in the collation will be noted in <u>underline</u>, while added or deleted words in <b>bold</b>. <s>Strikethroughs</s> are used to represent cancelled words in the original manuscript sources.</p>
            <p>It should be noted here that the two printed editions examind here are both based on the manuscript history version, and thus little revision found between them. The majority of the revisions are found between the original minutes and the history version.</p>
            <p>Commentary: When documents were copied into the manuscript history, they were often changed to the first person as if Joseph had recorded the documents and events themselves. This is no exception. There are also some typical grammatical edits scattered here and there. For example, a common one is the removal of the outdated '&c' term in the 20th century. The only major change is the redaction of the statement where Joseph speaks of his transgressions, which never made it into the manuscript history.</p>
