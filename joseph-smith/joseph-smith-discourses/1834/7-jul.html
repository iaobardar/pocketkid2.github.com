            <p>Event: Council of High Priests</p>
            <p>Location: Lyman Wight's house, Clay County, Missouri</p>
            <p>This is a brief sketch of a discourse of Joseph Smith, given in Missouri, at the organization of the Missouri High Council, which was considered the presidency of the church in Missouri, in Joseph Smith's abscence. Frederick G. Williams was the official clerk, and the minutes were copied into Minute Book 2 (Far West Record) in 1838 by Levi Richards and Ebenezer Robinson. It was edited lightly and copied into the Manuscript History in August 1843 by Willard Richards, and printed in February 1846 in the <i>Times and Seasons</i> "History of Joseph Smith" serial as well as the later B. H. Roberts <i>History of the Church</i>.</p>
            <p>The table contains links to the different editions, their labels, and the introductory material that will not be compared in the collation. Notable differences (not misspellings or capitalization differences) in the collation will be noted in <u>underline</u>, while added or deleted words in <b>bold</b>. <s>Strikethroughs</s> are used to represent cancelled words in the original manuscript sources.</p>
            <p>Commentary: The introductory material was rephrased to fit the narrative, but otherwise matches, and mainly just changes from the third to first person.</p>
