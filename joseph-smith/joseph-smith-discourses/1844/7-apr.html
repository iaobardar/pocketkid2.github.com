        <div class="intro">
            <p>Commonly known as the "King Follett Discourse", this speech is known for being Joseph's most famous and controversial speech. It was given on the afternoon of Sunday, April 7th, at the April General Conference of the church in Nauvoo. Reports of the discourse were taken primarily by four individuals, namely, Thomas Bullock, William Clayton, Willard Richards, and Wilford Woodruff. The first three had all served as clerks and scribes to Joseph and the church, and Bullock was the official clerk of the conference. Wilford Woodruff was not an official clerk and did not become directly involved in the history until much later, yet he kept a faithful record of many of Joseph Smith's teachings in his journal. His journal account appears to have been written after the fact, but based on notes taken at the conference. This helps to explain how it appears slightly different and more polished than the other three accounts.</p>
            <p>The first printing of this speech appeared in the 15 Aug. 1844 issue of the <i>Times and Seasons</i> newspaper, as minutes of the April conference, and was amalgamated from the Thomas Bullock and William Clayton report. The second major printing of this speech appeared in the 8 July 1857 issue of <i>The Deseret News</i> which was publishing the "History of Joseph Smith" serial, which in turn was based on the Manuscript History. The Manuscript History book E-1 contains two amalgamations of the speech, with a third additional draft existing in the Church History Library archives.</p>
            <p>In the early 1900s, B. H. Roberts produced a manuscript of the speech, based off of the one in the Manuscript History, for his seven volume <i>History of the Church</i>. Originally intended for volume six, pages 302-317, it was redacted from the first printing due to concerns of some General Authorities. This can be seen in copies of the first edition of volume six when the page numbering jumps from 301 on one page to 318 on the next. Decades later, it was added back in it's proper place, and it is there today. Most modern printings of the speech are taken from this version.</p>
            <p>In the Winter 1978 issue of BYU Studies, Stan Larson provided a fresh amalgamation of the King Follett Discourse that doesn't rely on existing amalgamations, and instead focuses on the original manuscripts, sticking with them as close as possible. It will be included in the comparison on this page.</p>
            <p>In addition to the four primary manuscripts, there were a small handful of journal summaries of the discourse made by individuals who attended the conference, such as George Laub, but they are not included in this study because they do not represent an attempt to capture the words of Joseph Smith, and thus cannot truly be compared with the ones that do.</p>
            <p>There are over a dozen versions worth examining, but for space reasons this page will focus on the four primary manuscripts and three primary printed editions. They are: 1) the first printing in the Times and Seasons, 2) the first major revision amalgamation, and 3) the more recent amalgamation by Stan Larson at BYU. Other related editions may be compared in the future on other pages.</p>
